- Invert the green color channel.
- Invert the blue color channel.
- Flatten the red color channel.
- Flatten the green color channel.
- Flatten the blue color channel.

- Make the image entirely green.
- Make the image entirely blue.
- Convert the image to grayscale.
- Apply a biochromatic red effect.
- Apply a biochromatic green effect.
- Apply a biochromatic blue effect.
- Create a mirrored portrait of the image.
- Generate a Warhol-style image with four copies of the original image.
- Pixelate the image with a specified degree of pixelation.
- Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise.
- Perform edge detection on the image.
- Convert the image into an ASCII representation.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the `ImageEditor.java` file using the following command: javac ImageEditor.java
3. Run the program using the following command: java ImageEditor
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose an effect and provide the necessary inputs.
5. Enter a name for the modified image file when prompted.
6. The modified image will be saved as a JPEG file in the same directory as the program.

Note: Before running the program, make sure to replace the placeholder image file name `amongus.jpg` with the actual name of your input image file. The input image should be present in the same directory as the program.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the Image Editor program:
invertImage
invertRed
invertGreen
invertBlue
flattenRed
flattenGreen
flattenBlue
makeRed
makeGreen
makeBlue
makeGrayScale
makeBiochromaticRed
makeBiochromaticGreen
makeBiochromaticBlue
mirroredPortrait
makeWarhol
pixelate
rotateClockWise
edgeDetection
asciiImage
Enter a number to choose an effect: 4

Enter a name for your file: inverted_image.jpg


This will apply the "invertBlue" effect to the input image and save the modified image as `inverted_image.jpg`.
